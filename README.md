Kindle Clippings Parser
=======================

This is a simple parser for the Kindle "My Clippings.txt" file.

I really love the fact that you can actually hightlight certain parts of your books, especially when you want to revisit interesting ideas and quotes later on.

For this reason I created this simple parser that generates a Markdown/HTML document for each book.

Unfortunately, the "My Clippings" format is not language independent - hence the parser only works for German clippings. However, it should be fairly easy to rewrite the regular expressions to match the English format as well.
